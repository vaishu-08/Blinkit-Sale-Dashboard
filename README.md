## Data story :
The Blinkit provides key insights into product sales, consumer preferences, and market trends. Fruits and vegetables are the top-selling items, reflecting high demand for daily essentials, while beverages have moderate sales. Low-fat products outperform regular ones, showing a shift towards healthier choices. Sales grew steadily from 2011 to 2017, spiked in 2018, but saw a decline in 2020, likely due to the pandemic. By 2022, sales stabilized, indicating market recovery. To optimize performance, businesses should ensure stock availability for high-demand products, introduce promotions for slow-selling items, and expand healthier options to meet evolving consumer needs.
